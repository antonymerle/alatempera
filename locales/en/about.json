  "aboutContent": "I paint illustrations for children using the egg tempera technique. All my illustrations are painted on wood with pigments. Egg tempera is an ancient technique that was predominantly used before oil painting.\nEach of my paintings is unique.\nI live in Anglet, on the Basque Coast. The pine forest near my house helps me paint the landscapes of my illustrations.\nI began drawing and painting to decorate my children's rooms. I find that painting on wood is softer and warmer than framed posters. At first, I would copy images from books that we enjoyed. It took years of practice before I started drawing my own characters and landscapes.",
  "techniqueContent": "To paint my tableaux Ã  la tempera, I use powdered pigments. I work with 12 colors: vine black, tiona white, light yellow ocher, Nicosie green, turquoise green, chrome oxide green, burnt sienna, battle yellow, cinnabar red, and ultramarine blue, and my favorite, red ocher.\nI love the poetry of their names. With these 12 pots, I get almost all the shades I want. The colors are not ready in advance.\nEvery time I sit at my work table, I mix some pigment powder with fresh egg yolk and water. It's the emulsion that gives a paint ready to use. If I put too much egg yolk, my paint will be too oily and won't adhere well to the wood. If I put too much water, it will be too diluted and lose color intensity.\nI use a pipette to take the egg yolk. And I make my mixture on a white plate.\nThe prepared paint dries quickly. You have to hurry to make the backgrounds. This is especially inconvenient when I work on large formats. When I've prepared a color, I paint everything that needs to be painted in that color on the tableau.\nNormally, tempera paint is applied to wood covered with a layer of gesso. I no longer use gesso; I now apply my colors directly to the wood. The colors are less vibrant, but I like that you can see the veins and texture of the wood through them.\nFor each tint, I prepare at least 3 shades, lighter or darker. They will be used to create shadows.\nIt's not possible to create gradients when painting with tempera. The play of shadow and light is done by layering colors from the same palette. I apply the lightest shade first and cover it with darker shades where needed. It's also possible to obtain shadow effects by controlling the deposit of pigments on the wood. The area where I apply the most pigments with my brush will be darker.\nWhen my painting is finished, I don't varnish it. I've abandoned commercial varnishes, even those adapted to tempera because they made the paintings crack after a few years. With egg yolk, the paint doesn't move. I read somewhere that it would even resist if soaked in water, but I haven't tried it!"
